    "\n",
    "Raw data is the fuel behind the most important innovations of these days. It's a pity that many organizations keep their data secret. On the one hand, I understand their reasons; on the other, history has shown that open-source contributions drive innovation like, or even more than, competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why we set on a mission to publish everything we do and make it reproducible. One of the first things we did was to take a complicated machinery developed by researchers at the Communication Systems Department\n",
    "of Sophia-Antipolis, France, that was already open-sourced and we made it more easily accessible and 100% reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is... _a lot_ of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a system that simulates road traffic in the Principality of Monaco for ten hours, starting from 4am. It basically is a fairly large network of roads (think of a graph) inside which vehicles of any type and pedestrians  move (think of objects moving from node to node of a graph).\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is that every vehicle is equipped with a GPS-like sensor. Therefore, at the end of the simulation, we can retrieve instantaneous positions and speed information for each vehicle. That sounds like a great dataset!\n",
    "\n",
    "We've done this already, put all data in CSV format as well as loaded them into a PostgreSQL database. Then (suprise!), we simply published the data on the internet. You can download all of them on your computer without even asking. And you can reproduce the experiment (or run your own) in a couple of clicks. Careful though, it's many gigabytes of data-- may take a while. I would recommend to first read this through [this article](url) that shows some interesting exploratory data analysis done over a subset of the data. **ADD LINK**"

    "\n",
    "In fact, I am not even sure how many records are there. For sure, it's fixed size, therefore I could theoretically download the CSV, wait for probably a few hours, then run a `wc -l` to know its size, wait several minutes and then I'd get the number. And then... what?\n",
    "\n",
    "I suspect the dataset contains about 100 million rows, but this information is useless. I also know it's a CSV of around 8 GB (I can see the file size in the browser when it asks me to confirm the download), but this information is not very useful either.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was not given a cluster of computers with a lot of memory. I am using my laptop with 8G of fast memory. Even if I download the entire file, how am I supposed to load it into memory?\n",
    "\n",
    "The same problem applies to the PostgreSQL database. For sure the database has a lot of advantages over the CSV file (and the unique disadvantage that you need to know a bit of SQL!), but it comes with problems too. First of all, to maintain it costs money. I was forbidden by my team to run a `select count(*)` which would consume a lot of memory and maybe even take down the CPU of the server that hosts the DB. In fact, I suspect that our database administrator has disabled queries like that one. Imagine if I were to take down the entire server!\n",

Again, I can't just scan the whole population to get the \"true\" answer, hence I will need to resort to some different technique and come up with a data-driven approximation of the \"true\" answer.\n",

    "\n",
    "**What are the most congested spots?**\n",
    "\n",
    "I am still thinking about a 2D map of the city. It would surely be useful to know where traffic gets the worst. I believe this can be interpreted in multiple ways: I could say that it's bad traffic if there a lot of cars, or if the speed is very low. This point will probably drive further analysis.\n",

    "_Sampling_ literally means to extract a few elements from the population. The most famous example of it is probably the [Urn problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urn_problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to urns and health studies I am in a advantageous position. Here the population sits in a database therefore I can take as many samples as we want. There are however a few gotchas to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I shouldn't rely on the fact that \"it's a database so I can look at the whole\". In fact, I cannot. Not only because the size is very large, but rather because it's unknown. Somebody may put more data in there, at any time.\n",
    "- I have be careful on the load I put on the database CPU. Hundreds, or low thousands of records should be fine.\n",
    "- The samples have to be taken as randomly as possible. As you know, it's not easy to have real randomness in computer systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, PostgreSQL is here for the rescue.\n",
    "\n",
    "From version 9.5, PostgreSQL supports an operator called [TABLESAMPLE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/sql-select.html). Like the name suggests, this allows to take a sample of a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Few, very important things to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `TABLESAMPLE` can be applied either with `SYSTEM` or with `BERNOULLI` as sampling method. The first one is _very_ fast, because it's based on blocks/pages, but because of this it's not really random. The latter is slower, but offer better randomization, and is the one I will use.\n",
    "- It requires a real number between 0 and 100, that represents the percentage of the table to sample. However, the result will not be the _exact_ percentage of rows, just a close number.\n",
    "- `TABLESAMPLE` is applied _before_ the `WHERE` clause. Hence, if I want to have 100 rows all respecting a certain condition, I have to sample more to try to get close to 100 after the `WHERE` is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very brief overview and you should definitely read up the documentation for more details. There are some takeways for the experiments I will be working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, `TABLESAMPLE` can be _seeded_. This is common practice in numerical simulation, to initialize all pseudo-random algorithms with a seed, so that the experiment is reproducible. However, in this case I think it's unnecessary -- it doesn't fit well the inferential set-up, in my opinion. I will not seed the samples, hence keep in mind that when you run the notebook the results may vary slightly. **?TODO?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The second point I want to make is about the percentage used to select the sample. I want to underline that the percentage doesn't offer guarantee on the total number of records in the database, nor it does about the number of rows I will get in output! PostgreSQL _tries_ to select that percentage of rows, but for efficiency reasons it may actually be a different value. In other words, if I use 0.1 and I get back 1000 records, it doesn't mean that there are 10,000 records in total. In fact, if I run the same command again I may get a slightly different number."

    "\n",
    "Second, on the same subject, the ThreadPoolExecutor may not be the best option for this task. Some test is needed, in my opinion. It's well known that ThreadPool is recommended to I/O-bound operations, and database queries surely fall into this bucket. However, to make things more complicated there's the `connection` object and the pandas `read_sql` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had initially created only one `connection` and passed it as argument of each thread, but this somehow made the whole execution sequential. This pattern is commonly used in Web Services (and API), where you definitely don't want to create a new connection for every piece of code that you run to handle an incoming request; it's better to create the connection once and then pass it around.\n",
    "\n",
    "This didn't work here, as if the `psycopg2` connection object queues the queries in the same connection internally; this is just my guess and I haven't verified it yet. Either way, I decided to make the threads so that each of them creates a new connection, but I also limited the number of workers in the pool to 5. If everything makes sense then the total time for running 10 experiments with 5 workers in a ThreadPool should be the same as running two single queries, sequentially, which means ~4 minutes."

    "This very, very brief exploratory analysis reveals a few things worth noting:\n",
    "\n",
    "**There are a lot of time instants where a lot of vehicles have speed equals to zero!** This actually makes sense: in a city, the stop-and-go dynamics is the most common. That being said, it's important to keep this in mind because zeros will inevitably drive down the overall average, while not being necessarily bad, or wrong things.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a timeseries dataset I could go deeper into this and find alternatives that take this problem into account. I could, for instance, consider the average for each vehicle computed over a few consecutive time steps; the idea is that if the average was low for many consecutive time instants, then it would mean something's not working well; if it was for one time instant only (or few of them) then it's a normal occurrence.\n",
    "\n",

    "**On the other hand, non-zero values do make sense**. When I briefly looked at this sample distribution with a boxplot by first removing speed values lower than 1 km/h, then I can tell that such distribution is reasonable. This is the plot in the center of the figure above. For an explanation of boxplot I recommend the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot).\n",
    "\n",
    "**When including zero values, nothing makes sense anymore**. I added a third plot (far right) that is a boxplot of the whole sample (hence, not removing any speed value). The very high number of zero values makes the distribution so skewed that it doesn't offer any meaningul insight (the box is collapsed somewhere near the zero). This is a repetition of the concept expressed in the first point above.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The standard deviation is big anyway**. No matter if I include zero-valued speed samples or not, the standard deviation turns out to be a pretty big number. The so-called _coefficient of variation_, computed by dividing the standard deviation over the mean value, is much higher than 1 --hence very large. I already know that this will make my confidence interval less _confident_, but at the same time it's a good descriptor of the population."
