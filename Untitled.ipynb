    "## The data (and the story behind it)\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw data is the fuel behind the most important innovations of these days. It's a pity that many organizations keep their data secret. On the one hand, I understand their reasons; on the other, history has shown that open-source contributions drive innovation like, or even more than, competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why we set on a mission to publish everything we do and make it reproducible. One of the first things we did was to take a complicated machinery developed by researchers at the Communication Systems Department\n",
    "of Sophia-Antipolis, France, that was already open-sourced and we made it more easily accessible and 100% reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is... _a lot_ of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a system that simulates road traffic in the Principality of Monaco for ten hours, starting from 4am. It basically is a fairly large network of roads (think of a graph) inside which vehicles of any type and pedestrians  move (think of objects moving from node to node of a graph).\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is that every vehicle is equipped with a GPS-like sensor. Therefore, at the end of the simulation, we can retrieve instantaneous positions and speed information for each vehicle. That sounds like a great dataset!\n",
    "\n",
    "We've done this already, put all data in CSV format as well as loaded them into a PostgreSQL database. Then (suprise!), we simply published the data on the internet. You can download all of them on your computer without even asking. And you can reproduce the experiment (or run your own) in a couple of clicks. Careful though, it's many gigabytes of data-- may take a while. I would recommend to first read this through [this article](url) that shows some interesting exploratory data analysis done over a subset of the data. **ADD LINK**"

    "## Data Settings\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is definitely great, though it presents an obvious obstacle to start with: it's a bit too large!\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, I am not even sure how many records are there. For sure, it's fixed size, therefore I could theoretically download the CSV, wait for probably a few hours, then run a `wc -l` to know its size, wait several minutes and then I'd get the number. And then... what?\n",
    "\n",
    "I suspect the dataset contains about 100 million rows, but this information is useless. I also know it's a CSV of around 8 GB (I can see the file size in the browser when it asks me to confirm the download), but this information is not very useful either.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was not given a cluster of computers with a lot of memory. I am using my laptop with 8G of fast memory. Even if I download the entire file, how am I supposed to load it into memory?\n",
    "\n",
    "The same problem applies to the PostgreSQL database. For sure the database has a lot of advantages over the CSV file (and the unique disadvantage that you need to know a bit of SQL!), but it comes with problems too. First of all, to maintain it costs money. I was forbidden by my team to run a `select count(*)` which would consume a lot of memory and maybe even take down the CPU of the server that hosts the DB. In fact, I suspect that our database administrator has disabled queries like that one. Imagine if I were to take down the entire server!\n",
    "\n",

    "My question refers more to the maximum number of objects that are moving in the network _at the same time_. Again, I can't just scan the whole population to get the \"true\" answer, hence I will need to resort to some different technique and come up with a data-driven approximation of the \"true\" answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**From where do most vehicles enter the network?**\n",
    "\n",
    "I think it can be very useful to present at my next team meeting a 2D map of the city that shows the hotspots where a lot of objects enter the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the most congested spots?**\n",
    "\n",
    "I am still thinking about a 2D map of the city. It would surely be useful to know where traffic gets the worst. I believe this can be interpreted in multiple ways: I could say that it's bad traffic if there a lot of cars, or if the speed is very low. This point will probably drive further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the highest speed vehicles travel at?**\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "With respect to urns and health studies I am in a advantageous position. Here the population sits in a database therefore I can take as many samples as we want. There are however a few gotchas to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I shouldn't rely on the fact that \"it's a database so I can look at the whole\". In fact, I cannot. Not only because the size is very large, but rather because it's unknown. Somebody may put more data in there, at any time.\n",
    "- I have be careful on the load I put on the database CPU. Hundreds, or low thousands of records should be fine.\n",
    "- The samples have to be taken as randomly as possible. As you know, it's not easy to have real randomness in computer systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckly, PostgreSQL is here for the rescue.\n",
    "\n",
    "From version 9.5, PostgreSQL supports an operator called [TABLESAMPLE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/sql-select.html). Like the name suggests, this allows to take a sample of a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Few, very important things to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `TABLESAMPLE` can be applied either with `SYSTEM` or with `BERNOULLI` as sampling method. The first one is _very_ fast, because it's based on blocks/pages, but because of this it's not really random. The latter is slower, but offer better randomization, and is the one I will use.\n",
    "- It requires a real number between 0 and 100, that represents the percentage of the table to sample. However, the result will not be the _exact_ percentage of rows, just a close number.\n",
    "- `TABLESAMPLE` is applied _before_ the `WHERE` clause. Hence, if I want to have 100 rows all respecting a certain condition, I have to sample more to try to get close to 100 after the `WHERE` is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very brief overview and you should definitely read up the documentation for more details. There are some takeways for the experiments I will be working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, `TABLESAMPLE` can be _seeded_. This is common practice in numerical simulation, to initialize all pseudo-random algorithms with a seed, so that the experiment is reproducible. However, in this case I think it's unnecessary -- it doesn't fit well the inferential set-up, in my opinion. I will not seed the samples, hence keep in mind that when you run the notebook the results may vary slightly. **?TODO?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The second point I want to make is about the percentage used to select the sample. I want to underline that the percentage doesn't offer guarantee on the total number of records in the database, nor it does about the number of rows I will get in output! PostgreSQL _tries_ to select that percentage of rows, but for efficiency reasons it may actually be a different value. In other words, if I use 0.1 and I get back 1000 records, it doesn't mean that there are 10,000 records in total. In fact, if I run the same command again I may get a slightly different number."
